abstract = "The widespread location-based social networks (LB- SNs) have immersed into our daily life. As an open platform, LBSNs typically allow all kinds of users to register accounts. Malicious attackers can easily join and post misleading in- formation, often with the intention of influencing the users’ decision in urban computing environments. To provide reliable information and improve the experience for legitimate users, we design and implement DeepScan, a malicious account detection system for LBSNs. Different from existing approaches, DeepScan leverages emerging deep learning technologies to learn users’ dynamic behavior. In particular, we introduce the long short- term memory (LSTM) neural network to conduct time series analysis of user activities. DeepScan combines newly introduced time series features and a set of conventional features extracted from user activities, and exploits a supervised machine learning- based model for detection. Using the real traces collected from Dianping, a representative LBSN, we demonstrate that DeepScan can achieve an excellent prediction performance with an F1-score of 0.964. We also find that the time series features play a critical role in the detection system."
