abstract = "Given that the USA and Germany are the most populous countries in North America and Western Europe, understanding the behavioral differences between American and German users of online social networks is essential. In this work, we conduct a data-driven study based on the Yelp Open Dataset. We demonstrate the behavioral characteristics of both American and German users from different aspects, i.e., social connectivity, review styles and spatiotemporal patterns. In addition, we construct a classification model to accurately recognize American and German users according to the behavioral data. Our model achieves high classification performance with an F1-score of 0.891 and AUC of 0.949."
