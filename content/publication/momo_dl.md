# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Due to the rapid development of mobile devices andlocation-based services, location-based social networks(LBSNs)have become  very popular in our daily-life. Malicious accountdetection is very helpful for different kinds of practical applications. In this paper,  we explore the malicious account detectionproblem by introducing a deep learning-based framework. Byusing the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network, weare able to build a classifier to achieve the binary classification. Byusing the real data collected from Momo, a widely used LBSN which has more than 180 millio  users around the world, we evaluate our framework and the esults show great promise for malicious account detection tasks."
